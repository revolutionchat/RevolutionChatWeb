At Revolution, we want to make sure everyone on our platform is really safe. These are guidelines to tell how to deal with a relatively serious situation like your account getting hacked.
- If you have been harrassed, stalked (in real life), or groomed you should consider contacting proper authorities.
- Revolution shall not be held responsible for the breach of laws of another individual/group on this site.

1. Threats of Hacking
- If you are receiving threats from a (group of) individuals, it is recommended to fill out our report form. This may result in the offender's account getting disabled. (we only monitor private messages for this reason)

2. Unknown hacker(s) hacked your account
- If someone has hacked your account, message us in the discord server at .gg/UPkkSDy4wa including your account name and discriminator, time when you got hacked, and when you want to release the account from disabled mode. 
* You must have some proof that this was your account. Sensitive information like your IP address, old password and 2 Factor Authentication code won't suffice. Just tell us simple information like what was the last message that was sent to a user, etc.

> We are able to trace messages and conversations at any time. An investigation may take place at any time for any offender to get removed or disabled (for a number of days) off our platform.
